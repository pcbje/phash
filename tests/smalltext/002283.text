``Nonlocality gets more real''. This is the provocative title of a recent
report in Physics Today (1998). Three experiments are cited. All three
confirm to high accuracy the predictions of quantum theory in experiments
that suggest the occurrence of an instantaneous action over a large distance.
The most spectacular of the three experiments begins with the
production of pairs of photons in a lab in downtown Geneva. For some of
these pairs, one member is sent by optical fiber to the village
of Bellevue, while the other is sent to the town of Bernex.
The two towns lie more than 10 kilometers apart. Experiments on the arriving
photons are performed in both villages at essentially the same time. What
is found is this: The observed connections between the outcomes of these
experiments defy explanation in terms of ordinary ideas about the nature
of the physical world {\it on the scale of directly observable objects.}
This conclusion is announced in opening sentence of the
report (Tittle {\it et al.} 1998) that describes the experiment:
``Quantum theory is nonlocal''.
